New rules

From now on, all your classes must be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form,
unless explicitly stated otherwise. They will then implement the four required member
functions below:

• Default constructor
• Copy constructor
• Copy assignment operator
• Destructor

Split your class code into two files. The header file (.hpp/.h) contains the class
definition, whereas the source file (.cpp) contains the implementation.
