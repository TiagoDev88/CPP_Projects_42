# CPPs - C++ Learning Journey at 42

This repository contains my solutions for the C++ modules at 42 school. Each module focuses on different aspects of C++ programming, helping to build a strong foundation in object-oriented programming.

## Modules Overview

- **CPP 00**: Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and other basic concepts
- **CPP 01**: Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement
- **CPP 02**: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, orthodox canonical class form
- **CPP 03**: Inheritance
- **CPP 04**: Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces
- **CPP 05**: Repetition and Exceptions
- **CPP 06**: C++ casts
- **CPP 07**: C++ templates
- **CPP 08**: Templated containers, iterators, algorithms
- **CPP 09**: STL

## How to Use

Each module contains its own set of exercises. To compile and run:

```bash
cd CPPxx
make
./program_name
```
